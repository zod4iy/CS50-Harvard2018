This repository presents my solutions of the problem sets 1-5 of Harvard course CS50.
It's fully completed part of course in C language. 

pSet1: 
- hello : the most simple program, it's just prints “hello, world”;
- marioLess,marioMore: print # in pyramid order;
- cash: program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change;
- credit: program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm;

pSet2:
- caesar: program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher;
- vigenere: program that encrypts messages using Vigenère’s cipher;

pSet3:
- music: implementation of functions duration, frequency, is_rest;

pSet4:
- whodunit: program that reveals a hidden message in a BMP;
- resize: program that resizes BMPs;
- recover: program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image;

pSet5:
- speller: program that spell-checks a file.

This part of the course covers topics (in C language) like data types, operators, conditional statements,
loops, functions, command line arguments, pointers. In pset5 implemented hash table.
